# CppND-Capstone-SSD-Object-Detection

Capstone for Udacity Nanodegree in C++

## Requirements

- **OpenCV >= 4**
  - [Install instruction for Linux](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.1/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)
  - [Install istruction for Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-4-on-windows/)
  - [Install instruction for Mac](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-4-on-macos/)
- cmake >= 3.7
  - All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
- make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  - Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  - Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  - Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  - Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
- **GPU** is recommended

## Download models (Optional)

In this example I use MobileNet SSD from tensorflow to be implemented in opencv. Models were already downloaded in this project. Here shows how to download those models if needed.

In the root directory (this repository), execute the command below:

1. `mkdir models`

2.  download the model weights

    `wget https://github.com/rdeepc/ExploreOpencvDnn/raw/master/models/frozen_inference_graph.pb -O models/frozen_inference_graph.pb`


3. download the model architecture

    `wget https://github.com/rdeepc/ExploreOpencvDnn/raw/master/models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.pbtxt -O models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.pbtxt`

4. download the objection classes file to show results

    `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/samples/data/dnn/object_detection_classes_coco.txt  -O models/object_detection_classes_coco.txt `

## Build

In the root directory (this repository), execute the command below:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

The executable(`detect`) is created in the current directory(`build`).

## Run

In `build` directory, run the executable like below:

`./detect [options] <image file>`

This reads an image file and show the result of object detection. `<image file>` should be a path to the file you want to input.

#### Options

- `-c` : specifies _confidence threshold_ between 0 and 1.0. If omitted, default value is 0.5. (example: `-c=0.3`)
- `-n` : specifies the threshold used for _Non-max Suppression_ between 0 and 1.0. If omitted, default value is 0.5. (example: `-n=0.7`)
- `-h` `-?` `--help` `--usage`: Show usage.

#### Example

`./detect -c=0.2 ../images/apple1_0.2.mp4`
